# Multi-Client-Database-Multi-Threading-
In this project I created a multi-client database in python.\
I used semaphore for handling the threads in order to use multi-threading. I also used pickle in order to have a dictionary as my database.

## To Run: ##
In this project I used python 2.7. If you want to run this project you will need to have a pickled dictionary in a text file called `database.txt`.\
In the same folder as the text file you will need to download the client side and the server side .py files.\
In order to run the the client and the server you can use cmd and type ```python client.py``` for the client or ```python server.py``` for the server.

I hope you enjoy this project, and if you have and suggestions please let me know!
